As soon as we came into this college we were greeted by a 21 days long orientation programme.We had assumed that after  coming to college so far away from home we would be feeling homesick  and very sad but little had we known what the college had in store for us.Right from morning 6:30 to 8:30 at night the college had prepared a rigorous orientation schedule which started with yoga or karate sessions early morning which literally seemed to be torture for us...following that there were guest lectures,way too many motivational speeches ,some classes on basic subjects like maths,c,English and department visits and some trips to the city temples and museums..To make things worse and to add to my hectic schedule I had to learn cycling right from scratch which was a pretty difficult task.The only positive point about this whole thing was that we never had enough time to feel homesick plus in those 21 days we all made amazing friends even before our academic session could take a kickstart

    After coming to college  the first fest that we heard about was festember,we heard that its the biggest  fest in the whole of south India...We all the first years were too excited about it..and really when festember finally came in the month of September it proved to be as huge as we had imagined it to be.I along with the gang of friends I had formed by then attended all the proshows enthusiastically and stayed out in the OAT dancing our hearts out till 3 in the morning which was something we were witnessing for the first time in our lives..Apart from the pro shows  eating out at the numerous food stalls and attending the worshops was pretty much fun too.All in all ,we realised tht festember is truly a fest to remember.

      Another thing that we heard about in this college which got us all amped up  is the  numerous clubs in this college to which we got introduced in the orientation programme.Personally I felt very excited on hearing about the tech clubs like spider ,delta,RMI,DC .Since I did not know much about anything I decided to attend the workshops to get an idea about the things tolearn..Then in the month of October came spider club’s u-con workshop on app development game development as well as tronix.With a lot of enthusiasm I applied for all 3.First came app development with the help of android s which was taught for a day,next day game development  on unity platform was taught.Then for about 4 days tronix  was taught in which we learnt about working with MSP430 microcontroller by coding in embedded C.Though it is not possible to teach these topics wholly in such a short span of time,the spider members did an awesome job in teaching us the basics very well and a huge benefit of this workshop was that we came to know about what we are personally keen towards.

      All first years were told right in the beginning that we cannot take part in any of the fests in the first year which was a bit disappointing but then we came to know about aaveg,a club exclusively formed by and for the first years.Aaveg comprises of the organising team ,content and design teams..Inductions were held for the various teams.Fortunately I managed to get into the OC team of aaveg .Being a part of OC was an absolutely fun filled experience because though aaveg is not as huge as the other college fests,for us first years to work as a team and organise events under the guidance of our second year aaveg seniors was truly awesome.The biggest benefit that I enjoyed was that my friends circle increased enormously and I came to know about so many people from other departments with whom I never had a chance to talk to before .Also the inter hostel competitive spirit was something so thrilling.Finally when aaveg ended with success with Agate hostel being crowned as winners,we all felt so proud of our hard work.

        Another big thing that we heard about after coming to college  was Pragyaan,the technical fest of this college which is considered to be the pride of NITT..It is an ISO certified fest.We firstyears could not participate in it but we enjoyed a lot.The infotainment shows,the exhibitions,guest lectures by renowned people,the  food stalls  and everything else was of top notch level.Personally I enjoyed Pragyaan more than I had enjoyed Festember.The best  part was the comedy show where EIC standup comedian Sorabh Pant and a tamil comedian Aravind Subhramaniam entertained us thoroughly with awesome stand up comedy acts.

        NITTFEST was a whole new experience different from the other  fests because it is an intra college fest  and more importantly for the first time we first years realized the fervour and love in our hearts for our own departments because NITTFEST is an entirely an inter department  competition based fest.Though we first years could not participate we did our best in cheering for our respective departments by attending all the events.Finally ECE was  crowned as the winner of nittfest 2k16.

        The best part about life in NITT is the cosmopolitan atmosphere.It literally seems to be a ,mini India to me.People  from various states, even countries and cultural backgrounds mingle perfectly to create a beautiful atmosphere here.The part I like the most is the tend of celebrating different festivals of different religions,communities and states in these colleges.In the first year I witnessed the celebration of various festivals like ganesh chaturthi,onam,ugadhi,saraswati puja,pongal,navaratri,diwali and so on.I being a Bengali actively took part in the celebration of saraswati puja.It felt great to celebrate my state’s festival so far away from home with so much grandeur and feasting.The best part about life in NITT is the cosmopolitan atmosphere.It literally seems to be a ,mini India to me.People  from various states, even countries and cultural backgrounds mingle perfectly to create a beautiful atmosphere here.The part I like the most is the tend of celebrating different festivals of different religions,communities and states in these colleges.In the first year I witnessed the celebration of various festivals like ganesh chaturthi,onam,ugadhi,saraswati puja,pongal,navaratri,diwali and so on.I being a Bengali actively took part in the celebration of saraswati puja.It felt great to celebrate my state’s festival so far away from home with so much grandeur and feasting.

        Little  had I expected to adapt myself  to hostel  life so quickly .Being a single child I never thought that I could adjust with people from various backgrounds so easily but as soon as my parents left me and went,the girls I met with started becoming like my family in no time.After that this one year we had immense fun in hostel  doing group studies ,having selfie and goupfie sessions,playing games,gossiping till late nights and doing so much more of such crazy stuff.Now hostel  feels no different from my home back in my native  place .   The only disappointment is that mess food sucks big time.
